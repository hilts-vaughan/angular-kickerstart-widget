            <b>KickWidget was developed by Vaughan Hilts...</b> as a project to be more familiar with vanilla JavaScript development and AngularJS development. It allows you to generate a widget based on your Kickstarter project using reward data and data pulled from the Kickstarter campaign. The project uses all modern HTML5 technologies but the widget itself uses only barebones JavaScript, with no dependencies such as JavaScript. This makes it a lot easier to embed on webpages that would normally be very simple and don't need the bloat of something like jQuery inside of them.
